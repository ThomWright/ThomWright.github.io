# Main heading

Some intro text with a [link](https://google.com).

## Sub-Heading

This is text with some *italics*.

### Sub-Sub-Heading

This is text with some **bold**.

#### Sub-Sub-Sub-Heading

A simple unordered list:

- item
- another item

And an ordered list:

1. Apples
2. Oranges

```typescript
const typescript = "code"

function test() {
  return "hello world"
}
```

```
A code block with no language: "string" 0.00
```

```plaintext
A plaintext block quote
```

Some `inline code`.

> A block quote

And that's it.
