## Context

Operations can fail partway through, leaving them in a partially complete state. Sometimes they might need driving to completion, otherwise the system might end up in an inconsistent state. In many client/server architectures, clients cannot be relied on to reliably retry until completion.

## Example

A password reset system might follow these steps when changing the password:

1. [Sync] Write the new password to the database
2. [Async] Send an email to the user, informing them that their password has changed

If something fails after step 1 then an email might never be sent unless there is something to guarantee it gets retried until completion.

## Problem

How do we ensure that an operation will always be driven to completion, even if it may fail partway through?

## Solution

There are various ways to design systems which reliably retry until completion.

A common example would be a messaging system which retries for a given duration or number of attempts, after which it puts the message into a dead letter queue. Messages in the dead letter queue can be manually retried as necessary.

For the password reset system above, if a `PasswordUpdated` event is published (e.g. using a [transactional outbox]({% link _failure-patterns/transactional-outbox.md %})), then the messaging system could guarantee that the email sending gets retried until success.

Other examples include:

- **[Transactional outbox]({% link _failure-patterns/transactional-outbox.md %})** – a separate process retries a subset of the operation.
- **[Completer]({% link _failure-patterns/completer.md %})** – a separate process retries the complete operation.
