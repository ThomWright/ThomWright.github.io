## Context

Some operations need to write to two or more transactional systems, and require the end result to be a complete success or complete failure. The operation terminating in a partial success state (having successfully written to only a subset of systems) is not acceptable, though this is an acceptable intermediate state.

## Prerequisites

Eventual consistency is acceptable.

It is worth introducing extra complexity.

## Example

A travel booking system needs to book a hotel and a flight. It must either book both, or neither.

## Problem

How do we perform multiple operations such that either they all (eventually) either succeed or get rolled back?

## Solution

Use a saga. Sagas are a sequence of transactions, and introduce the idea of **backwards recovery** to [resumable operations]({% link _failure-patterns/resumable-operation.md %}) and [recovery points]({% link _failure-patterns/recovery-point.md %}).

Model your operation as a set of states and transitions between those states. There will be a set of acceptable terminal states (including the initial state), and intermediate states. It must be possible to transition from any intermediate state to a terminal state. If forward progress is not possible, it should be possible to transition backwards to the initial state.

These backwards transitions are known as **compensating actions**, and are effectively a rollback mechanism.

For the travel booking example, we might have three states:

1. Nothing booked (initial state, terminal state) - `âˆ…`
2. Flight booked (intermediate state) - `FB`
3. Flight and hotel booked (terminal state) - `FB HB`

And two forward operations: `book flight` and `book hotel`. If we end up in a state where we've booked the flight but cannot book the hotel (e.g. because it is full), then we need the backward operation: `cancel flight`.

You will want some way to drive progress (either forwards or backwards). This can be a centralised system, such as a [completer]({% link _failure-patterns/completer.md %}) (known as *orchestration*), or distributed using e.g. [transactional outboxes]({% link _failure-patterns/transactional-outbox.md %}) (known as *choreography*).
