I'm Thom, a software engineer in Bristol, UK. I've worked in full stack web development since 2012.

Nowadays I mostly focus on designing and implementing reliable, observable and well-documented backend systems. Currently I'm especially enjoying doing so using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I write to learn and to teach. Often this writing is a way for me to organise my thoughts and try to make sense of things, hopefully in a way that's useful to others.

[All advice comes from a context](https://www.tedinski.com/2018/06/19/all-advice-has-context.html) ([see also](https://programmingisterrible.com/post/176657481103/repeat-yourself-do-more-than-one-thing-and)), mine included. I try to be explicit about this context, but don't always succeed.
